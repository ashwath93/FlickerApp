# FlickerApp
An app that fetches photos continuously.

Description:
The App fetches the complete list of recent photos and displays it as soon as it is launched. It also provides the functionality to 
search the photos with a specific text from the navigation bar. The app supports infinite scrolling when scrolling
through recents and searched photos. Further it provides better caching mechanisms which reduces the cost of unwanted 
network calls for fetching the same image repeatedly.

Improvements:
It would have been much better if designs can be performed according to iOS version (navigation bar search is available from iOS 11)
A detailed description of the images in the collection would be meaningfull since the title gets truncated in some titles.
